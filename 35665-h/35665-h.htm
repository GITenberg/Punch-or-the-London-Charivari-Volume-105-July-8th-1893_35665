<h3>PREFACE</h3></div>

<p>"<ins title="'Vox, et præterea nihil!': A voice and nothing else; sound without sense."><i>Vox, et præterea nihil!</i></ins>" murmured Somebody in the background.</p>

<p>"Who made that stale and inappropriate quotation?" exclaimed Mr. Oracle
<span class="sc">Punch</span>,
looking severely around the illustrious group gathered in his <i>sanctum</i>
about the brazen tripod which bore his brand-new Phonograph.</p>

<p>Nobody answered.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you are ashamed of yourself, whoever you are," snapped the Seer.</p>

<p>"Rather think the&mdash;a&mdash;Spook spoke," muttered a self-important-looking personage,
obliquely eyeing a shadowy visitor from Borderland.</p>

<p>"Humph! <span class="sc">Julia</span> may use <i>your</i> hand, but you will not trump
<i>mine</i>," retorted the Oracle. "If <i>revenants</i> knew what
nonsense is put into their spectral mouths by noodles and charlatans, they would
never return to be made spectral pilgarlics of."</p>

<p>"A ghost is a good thing&mdash;in a Christmas story!" laughed the jolly old gentleman
in a holly-crown. "Elsewhere it
is generally a fraud and a nuisance."</p>

<p>"Right, Father Christmas!" cried Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>. "But the <i>Voces</i> from
my Oracular Funograph are not ghostly
nothings, neither are they ambiguous, like the oracles of the Sibyl of Cumæ,&mdash;to
which, my eloquent Premier, some have
had the audacity to compare certain of <i>your</i> vocal deliverances."</p>

<p>The Old Oracular Hand smiled sweetly. "<i>Nescit vox missa reverti</i>," he
murmured. "Would that <span class="sc">Edison</span> could
invent a Party Leader's Phonograph whose utterances should satisfy at the time
without danger of being quoted against one
fifty years later by <span class="sc">Cleon</span> the Tanner, or <span class="sc">Agoracritus</span> the
Sausage-Seller, to whom even the Sibylline Books would scarce
have been sacred. But you and your Funograph&mdash;as you neatly call it&mdash;have never
been Paphlagonian, have never had to
give up to Party what was meant for Mankind."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> Womankind, surely, Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>?" subjoined the
Strong-minded Woman, glaring reproachfully through
her spectacles at the Anti-Woman's-Rights Premier. "I wish I could say as much
of <i>you</i>, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Labour and the Ladies seem to have small share in his thoughts," began the
Striker, hotly, when Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>
touched him gently on his fustian-clad shoulder, and he subsided.</p>

<p>"Am <i>I</i> not a lady?" queried <span class="sc">Hibernia</span>, with an affectionate glance
at her aged champion.</p>

<p>"Golly, and me too?" added a damsel of dusky Libyan charms, clinging close to
the stalwart arm of Napoleonic
<span class="sc">Cecil Rhodes</span>.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;with a difference!" said the Oracle, drily. "'<i>Place aux dames</i>' is a
motto of partial and rather capricious
application, is it not, my evergreen Premier?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span>

<p>"A principle of politeness rather than of politics or Parliament&mdash;at present,"
murmured the G. O. M.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" sniffed the Strong-minded Woman. "It will <i>spread</i>. Read Mr. <span class="sc">H.
Fowler's</span> Bill, and Dr. <span class="sc">Alfred
Russel Wallace's</span> <i>Woman and Natural Selection</i>; put this and that
together, and perpend!"</p>

<p>"The Penny Phonograph," pursued Mr. Oracle <span class="sc">Punch</span>, "is now prodigiously
patronised. For the popular penny you
can hear an American band, a Chevalier coster ballad, the 'Charge of the Light
Brigade,' a comic song by 'Little <span class="sc">Tich</span>,' or a
speech by the Old Man eloquent. No; for the latter I believe they charge
twopence. That <i>is</i> fame, my Pantagruelian
Premier. But in <i>my</i> Funograph&mdash;charge the unchangeable Threepence&mdash;you can
hear the very voice of Wisdom and Wit, of
Humanity and Humour, of Eloquence and Essential Truth, of Music and of Mirth!"</p>

<p>"Hear! hear! hear!" chorussed everybody.</p>

<p>"You <i>shall</i> hear!" said the Oracle. "Stand round, all of you, and adjust
your ear-tubes! <span class="sc">Dionysius's</span> <b>Ear</b> was not
an aural 'circumstance' (as your countryman would say, <span class="sc">Cleveland</span>)
compared with this. <i>Vox, et præterea nihil</i>, indeed!"</p>

<p>"<i>Nihil</i>&mdash;or Nihilism," growled the Trafalgar Square Anarchist, "is the
burden of the <i>vox populi</i> of to-day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Vox diaboli</i>, you mean," interrupted the great Funographer, sternly. "And
there is no opening for that <i>vox</i> here.
Shut up! You are here, misguided mischief-maker, not to spout murderously
dogmatic negation, but to listen and&mdash;I hope&mdash;learn!"</p>

<p>"I trust you have guidance for me," murmured gentle but anxious-faced Charity.
"It would, like my ministrations,
be most seasonable&mdash;as Father Christmas could tell you&mdash;for between my
innumerable claims, and my contradictory 'multitude
of counsellors,' my friends and enemies, my gushingly indiscriminate
enthusiasts, and my arid, hide-bound 'organisers,'
I was never, my dear Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>, so completely puzzled in my life."</p>

<p>"Sweet lady," responded the Oracle, with gentle gravity, "there is guidance here
for <i>all</i> who will listen; heavenly
Charity and diabolic Anarchy, eloquent Statesmanship and adventurous Enterprise,
scared Capital and clamorous Labour,
fogged Finance and self-assertive Femininity; for the motley and many-voiced
Utopia-hunters who fancy they see imminent
salvation in Imperial Pomp or Parochial Pump, in Constitutional Clubs or County
Councils, in Home Rule, Primrose
Leagues, or the Living Wage, in Democracy or in Dynamite, in High Art or
Mahatmas, in Science or in Spooks. Take
your places, Ladies and Gentlemen! Charity first, if you please, with Father
Christmas to her right, leaving room for the
little New Year on her left. Listen all, and learn by the various voices of that
many-cylindered, marvellous Funographic Machine, my</p>

<h3>THE HEALTH SEEKER'S VADE MECUM.</h3>

<h4>(<i>Revised up to Date.</i>)</h4>

<div class="ind1">
<p><i>Question.</i> Is it good for the
health to keep awake?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly not; as
sleep is most necessary to the
body's repose.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then should one go to sleep?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; for it must in the end
be injurious to the mind.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is walking a good thing?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not; as it may
lead to cramp.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is resting to be recommended?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh no; for exercise is absolutely
a necessity.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is riding permissible?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not when the wood pavement
produces the new sore throat.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Should we eat?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; for everything is adulterated.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Should we drink?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; liquor is injurious.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Should we starve?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; meals are really needful.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it safe to stay at home?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; because change of air
is most beneficial to everyone.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it advisable to go abroad?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not at all; many epidemics
are reported to be rife everywhere
on the other side of the channel.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it good to live?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Scarcely; because illness is
worse than death.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it good to die?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Probably; everything else
is a failure, so no doubt this, too,
is a grand mistake.</p>

<h2>SUB JUDICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>An entirely Imaginary Report of an
utterly Impossible Case.</i>)</p>

<h4><span class="sc">The Mustard Mystery. 120th Day.</span></h4>

<p>To-day the prisoner in this matter
was once again brought before the
magistrates on the charge already
stated. The same counsel were
present for the prosecution and the
defence that had put in an appearance
yesterday. The court was densely
crowded.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benjamin Brown</span> deposed that
he had often slammed a door. He
knew the sound of the slamming of
a door, and thought he could distinguish
it from the noise of an earthquake.
On cross examination he
admitted that he had not slammed
a door, and had never been present
at an earthquake. On re-examination
he said that although he had not
been present at an earthquake he was
conversant with its characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Jones</span> deposed that he had
once seen a man who might have
been the prisoner. It was sixteen
years ago. The man to whom he
referred was talking to a female.
On cross-examination he admitted
that, so far as he knew to the
contrary, the man may have been
addressing his grandmother. On re-examination
he did not know that
the female was a grandmother&mdash;she
might have been a grand aunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Richard Robertson</span> deposed that
he had seen a pair of slippers. They
might have been the slippers of the
prisoner. He saw one of those slippers
thrown with considerable force
at a water-butt. He had examined
the water-butt, and there was a mark
on it. On cross-examination he admitted
that he did not know how the
mark on the water-butt had been
made. It might have been by a boot,
and not a slipper. He did not know
to whom the slippers belonged.
They might have been the property
of the prisoner. He was not sure
that he had seen the slippers in the
presence of the prisoner. In fact,
he was not sure he had ever seen the
prisoner before. He was also doubtful
about the identity of the slippers.
However, on re-examination, he was
sure he had seen some slippers, and
also a water-butt.</p>

<p>After some further evidence, the
inquiry was adjourned until to-morrow.</p>

<h3>THE THREE GEORGES.</h3>

<p class="ind">The following two letters have
reached <i>Mr. Punch</i>, curiously
enough, by the same post. Here
they are, just as they were received:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Will you allow
me, through your columns, to thank
the public for the brilliant way in
which they are recognising my claims
to distinction? As I walk through
the streets I see evidence on all
hands that on Thursday night London
will be ablaze with "G. M."!
Permit me, Sir, thus publicly to thank
a discriminating public.&mdash;Yours Egoist-ically,</p>

<p class="author1"><span class="sc">G-orge M-r-d-th</span>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;The Alderman
in Art is beaten, and even the City is
one continuous tribute to "G. M."
Critics, envious of my <i>Speaker</i> reputation,
may carp, and say the tribute's

<h2>A TESTIMONIAL MANQUÉ.</h2>

<h4>(<span class="sc">A Sketch from the Suburbs.</span>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">The Argument</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Hotspur Porpentine</span>, <i>a distinguished
resident
in the rising suburb of Jerrymere, has recently been awarded
fourteen days' imprisonment, without the option of a fine, for
assaulting a ticket-collector, who had offered him the indignity
of requiring him to show his season-ticket at the barrier. The
scene is a Second-Class Compartment, in which four of</i>
Mr. <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span> <i>neighbours are discussing the affair during
their return from the City</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cockcroft (warmly).</i> I say, Sir&mdash;and I'm sure all here will
bear me out&mdash;that such a sentence was a scandalous abuse of justice.
As a near neighbour, and an intimate friend of <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span>,
I don't 'esitate to assert that he has done nothing whatever to forfeit
our esteem. He's a quick-tempered man, as we're all aware, and
to be asked by some meddlesome official to show his season, after
travelling on the line constantly for years, and leaving it at home that
morning&mdash;why&mdash;I don't blame him if he <i>did</i> use his umbrella!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch. (sympathetically).</i> Nor I. <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span> a man I've
always had a very 'igh respect
for ever since I came into this
neighbourhood. I've always
found him a good feller, and a
good neighbour.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filkins (deferentially).</i> I
can't claim to be as intimate
with him as some here; but, if
it isn't putting myself too far
forward to say so, I very cordially
beg to say ditto to those
sentiments.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 420px;"><a href="images/page4-700.png"><img src="images/page4-420.png" width="420" height="467" alt="'Well, he's had a sharp lesson,&mdash;there's no denying that.'" /></a>
<p class="center">Well, he's had a sharp lesson,&mdash;there's no denying that."</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Sibbering</i> (<i>who has never
"taken to"</i> <span class="sc">Porpentine</span>). Well,
he's had a sharp lesson,&mdash;there's
no denying that.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> Precisely, and it
occurs to me that when he&mdash;ah&mdash;returns
to public life, it would
be a kind thing, and a graceful
thing, and a thing he would&mdash;ah&mdash;appreciate
in the spirit it
was intended, if we were to
present him with some little
token of our sympathy and
unabated esteem&mdash;what do you
fellers think?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk.</i> A most excellent
suggestion, if my friend here
will allow me to say so. I, for
one, shall be proud to contribute
to so worthy an object.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch.</i> I don't see why
we shouldn't present him with
an address&mdash;'ave it illuminated,
and framed and glazed; sort of
thing he could 'ang up and 'and
down to his children after him
as an <i>heirloom</i>, y' know.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> I don't like to
throw cold water on any proposition, but if you want <i>my</i> opinion, I
must say I see no necessity for making a public thing of it in that
way.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> I'm with <span class="sc">Sibbering</span> there. The less fuss there is
about it, the better <span class="sc">Porpentine</span>'ll be pleased. My idea is to give
him something of daily use&mdash;a <i>useful</i> thing, y' know.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch.</i> Useful <i>or</i> ornamental. Why not his own portrait?
There's many an artist who would do him in oils, and guarantee a
likeness, frame included, for a five-pound note.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> If it's to be like <span class="sc">Porpentine</span>, it certainly won't be
<i>ornamental</i>, whatever else it is.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk.</i> It can't be denied that he is remarkably plain in the
face. We'd better, as our friend Mr. <span class="sc">Cockcroft</span> here proposes, make
it something of daily use&mdash;a good serviceable silk umberella now&mdash;that's
<i>always</i> appropriate.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> To make up for the one he broke over the collector's
head, eh? that's <i>appropriate</i> enough!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> No, no; you mean well, <span class="sc">Filkins</span>, but you must see
yourself, on reflection, that there would be a certain want of&mdash;ah&mdash;good
taste in giving him a thing like that under the circumstances.
I should suggest something like a hatstand&mdash;a handsome one, of
course. I happen to know that he has nothing in the passage at
present but a row of pegs.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> I should have thought he'd been taken down enough
pegs already.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk. (who resents the imputation upon his taste).</i> I can't say
what the width of Mr. <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span> passage may be, never having
been privileged with an invitation to pass the threshold, but unless
it's wider than ours is, he couldn't get a hatstand in if he tried, and
if my friend <span class="sc">Cockcroft</span> will excuse the remark, I see no sense&mdash;to
say nothing of good taste, about which perhaps I mayn't be qualified
to pass an opinion&mdash;in giving him an article he's got no room for.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker. (with warmth).</i> There's room enough in <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span>
passage for a whole host of hatstands, if that's all, and I know
what I'm speaking about. I've been in and out there often
enough. I'm&mdash;ah&mdash;a regular tame cat in that house. But if you're
against the 'atstand, I say no more&mdash;we'll waive it. How would it
do if we gave him a nice comfortable easy-chair&mdash;something he
could sit in of an evening, y' know?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> A touchy chap like <span class="sc">Porpentine</span> would be sure to fancy
we thought he wanted something soft after a hard bench and a
plank bed&mdash;you can't go and give him <i>furniture</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker. (with dignity).</i> There's a way of doing all things. I
wasn't proposing to go and chuck the chair <i>at</i> him&mdash;he's a sensitive
feller in many respects, and he'd feel <i>that</i>, I grant you. He can't
object to a little present of that sort just from four friends like ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch. (with a falling
countenance).</i> Oh! I thought it
was to be a general affair,
limited to a small sum, so that
all who liked could join in. I'd
no notion you meant to keep it
such a private matter as all that.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk.</i> Nor I. And, knowing
Mr. <span class="sc">Porpentine</span> so slightly
as I do, he might consider it
presumption in me, making myself
so prominent in the matter&mdash;or
else I'm sure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> There's no
occasion for anyone to be prominent,
except myself. You
leave it entirely in my 'ands.
I'll have the chair taken up
some evening to <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span>
house on a 'andcart, and drop
in, and just lead up to it carelessly,
if you understand me,
then go out and wheel the chair
in, make him try it&mdash;and there
you <i>are</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch.</i> There <i>you</i> are,
right enough; but I don't see
where <i>we</i> come in, exactly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk.</i> If it's to be confined
to just us four, I certingly
think we ought <i>all</i> to be present
at the presentation.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> That would be
just the very thing to put a man
like <span class="sc">Porpentine</span> out&mdash;a crowd
dropping in on him like that!
I know his ways, and, seeing
I'm providing the chair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch. (relieved).</i> You
are? That's different, of course; but I thought you said that we
four&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> I'm coming to that. As the prime mover, and a
particular friend of <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span>, it's only right and fair I should
bear the chief burden. There's an easy-chair I have at home that
only wants re-covering to be as good as new, and all you fellers need
do is to pay for 'aving it nicely done up in velvet, or what not, and
we'll call it quits.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch.</i> I daresay; but I like to know what I'm letting myself
in for; and there's upholsterers who'll charge as much for doing up
a chair as would furnish a room.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk.</i> I&mdash;I shouldn't feel justified, with my family, and, as,
comparatively speaking, a recent resident, in going beyond a certain
limit, and unless the estimate could be kep' down to a moderate sum,
I really&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb. (unmasking).</i> After all, you know, I don't see why we
should go to any expense over a stuck-up, cross-grained chap like
<span class="sc">Porpentine</span>. It's well-known he hasn't a good word to say for us
Jerrymere folks, and considers himself above the lot of us!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch and Mr. Filk.</i> I'm bound to say there's a good deal in
what <span class="sc">Sibbering</span> says. <span class="sc">Porpentine's</span> never shown himself what
<i>I</i>
should call sociable.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cocker.</i> I've never found him anything but pleasant myself,
whatever he may be to others. I'm not denying he's an <i>exclusive</i>
man, and a <i>fastidious</i> man, but he's been 'arshly treated, and <i>I</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
should have thought this was an occasion&mdash;if ever there was one&mdash;for
putting any private feelings aside, and rallying round him to
show our respect and sympathy. But of course if you're going to
let petty jealousies of this sort get the better of you, and leave me to
do the 'ole thing myself, <i>I've</i> no objection. I daresay he'll value it
all the more coming from me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> Well, he <i>ought</i> to, after the shameful way he's spoken
of you to a friend of mine in the City, who shall be nameless. You
mayn't know, and if not, it's only right I should mention it, that
he complained bitterly of having to change his regular train on your
account, and said (I'm only repeating his words, mind you) that Jerrymere
was entirely populated by bores, but you were the worst of the
lot, and your jabber twice a day was more than he <i>could</i> stand. He
mayn't have <i>meant</i> anything by it, but it was decidedly uncalled for.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cockcr. (reddening).</i> I 'ope I'm above being affected by the
opinion any man may express of my conversation&mdash;especially a cantankerous
feller, who can't keep his temper under decent control.
A feller who goes and breaks his umbrella over an unoffending
official's 'ead like that, and gets, very properly, locked up for it!
Jerrymere society isn't good enough for him, it seems. He won't be
troubled with much of it in future&mdash;<i>I</i> can assure him! Upon my
word, now I come to think of it, I'm not sure he shouldn't be called
upon for an explanation of how he came to be travelling without a
ticket; it looks very much to me as if he'd been systematically
defrauding the Company!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Filk.</i> Well, I didn't like to say so before; but that's been <i>my</i>
view all along!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Balch.</i> And mine.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sibb.</i> Now perhaps you understand why we'd rather leave it
to you to give him the arm-chair.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cockcr.</i> <i>I</i> give a man an arm-chair for bringing disgrace on
the 'ole of Jerrymere! I'd sooner break it up for firewood! Whoever
it was that first started all this tomfoolery about a testimonial, I'm
not going to 'ave <i>my</i> name associated with it, and if you'll take
<i>my</i>
advice, you'll drop it once and for all, for it's only making yourselves
ridiculous! [<i>His companions, observing that he is in a somewhat
excited condition, consider it advisable to change the subject.</i></p>

<p class="center">"O my prophetic sole, my ankle!"</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 27.</i>&mdash;<i>Faust</i>, in French. <span class="sc">Jean de Reszke</span> was
to have
been <i>Faust</i>, but the "vaulting ambition" of the eminent Polish tenor
led him to attempt a high jump with another Pole&mdash;the leaping-pole&mdash;and
whether he had not his compatriot well in hand, or whether,
"with love's light
wings," <i>Roméo</i> did
<i>not</i> manage to "o'ertop"
the highest note
above the line, deponent
sayeth not,
but this much is
known, that he fell
at the high jump,
and, feeling the pain
first in the under
part of his foot, and
then in the leg, he
exclaimed, with
<i>Hamlet</i>, "O my
prophetic sole, my
ankle!" the result
being that he appeareth
not to-night
as <i>Faust</i>. If Frère
<span class="sc">Jean de Reszke</span> is
going on by "leaps
and bounds" in this
manner, he will be
known as "Brother
<span class="sc">John</span> the Risky."
Madame <span class="sc">Nordica</span> happy as <i>Marguerite</i>&mdash;at least she looked it, for
even in the most tragic scenes there is always a sweet smile on her
dimpled cheeks. Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span> makes a <i>Marta</i> of herself as
the merry old dame; Mlle. <span class="sc">Guercia</span>, as <i>Siebel</i>, is a Siebeline
mystery; <span class="sc">Lassalle</span>, as <i>Valentine</i>, pleases <i>la salle</i>; but

them then this is the Bi-Cycle, but there's more woe than weal in
it, and though extracts may be relished by the learned amateur, yet, as
a whole, <span class="sc">Wagner's</span> <i>Tristan</i> does not attract our opera-going

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Here's a hand, my fine fellows; in friendship you come,</p>

<p><span class="sc">Skinners and Skinned.</span>&mdash;One portion of the ancient award of
Sir <span class="sc">Robert Billesdon</span>, Lord Mayor of London, in settling a dispute
between the Skinners and Merchant Taylors, was, that these two
Companies should dine together once a year. Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Bruce</span>,
alluding to this at the banquet on Skinners Day, when, as was
natural, many lawyers were present, suggested that it would be a
good thing if power were given to judges to "condemn litigants to
dine together, and to order that the costs of the dinner should come
out of the Consolidated Fund"&mdash;a very good notion. The idea
might be extended to entertaining Wards in Chancery, of whom two
unhappy infants the other day were had up at the Police Court for
picking and stealing, in order to feed themselves and keep themselves
alive until they should reach the age when they would come
into their Chancery-bound property of something like £20,000. The
magistrate ordered an inquiry, but of "subsequent proceedings"
we have not as yet seen any record.</p>

<p class="center">Scene from New Ballet.</p>

<p class="center">Conductor Jacobi Demonio charming the public to the Alhambra.</p></div>

<p>Mons. <span class="sc">Jacobi</span> is a wonderful
man. The undefeated
hero of a hundred ballets&mdash;there
or thereabouts&mdash;still
beats time and the record
with his bâton at the
Alhambra; and his music,
specially composed for <i>Fidelia</i>,
is to be reckoned among
his ordinary triumphs.
<i>Fidelia</i> is "a new Grand
Romantic Ballet," in four
tableaux, and its performance
justifies its promise.
It is "new," it is decidedly
"grand," it is absorbingly
"romantic," and there's no
denying that it is a <i>Ballet
d'action</i>. But, as in the
oft-quoted reply when little
<i>Peterkin</i> asked "what it
was all about," so will the
ballet-case-hardened spectator
say, "'Why that I
cannot tell,' quoth he, 'But
'twas a <ins title="transcriber's note: original read 'spendid'">splendid</ins> victory!'"
Somebody, possibly one
<i>Tartini</i>, played by Signorina
<span class="sc">Cormani</span>, is in love with
<i>Fidelia</i>, Signorina <span class="sc">Pollini</span>,
as naturally anyone would
be; when a comic servant,
Mr. <span class="sc">George Lupino</span>, is
frightened by a Demon
Fiddler with his fiddle (both
being played by <span class="sc">Paganini
Redivivus</span>) who either
assists the lovers or does
his best to prevent their
coming together, I am not
quite clear which. Up to
the last it seemed doubtful
whether the Demon Doctor
was a good or bad spirit,
or a little mixed. His
appearance is decidedly
against him, as he looks the
very deuce. But I am inclined
to think that he was
a "<i>bon diable</i>," and was
doing everything, as everybody
else on the stage and
in the orchestra does, for
the best. After all, and
before all, the show is the
thing, and this will rank, as
it does now, among the best
of the greatest attractions
hitherto provided by the
Alhambra Company for an
appreciative public and for</p>

<p>Three years ago an
American firm issued a
princely edition of <i>The
Memoir of Horace Walpole</i>,
written by <span class="sc">Austin
Dobson</span>. It was too expensive
for mere Britishers,
and only a small number
of copies found their way
to this country. But the
literary work was so excellent,
that it was pronounced a pity it should be entombed in
this costly sarcophagus. Messrs. <span class="sc">Osgood, McIlvaine, &amp; Co.</span> have
now brought out an edition, in a single handsome volume, at a
reasonable price. <span class="sc">Horace Walpole</span> has often been written about
since he laid down the pen, but never by a more sympathetic hand
than Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson's</span>, nor by one bringing to the task fuller knowledge
of <span class="sc">Walpole's</span> time and contemporaries. The charm of style extends
even to the notes, usually in books of this class a tantalising adjunct.
Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson's</span> are so full of information, and so crisply told, that
they might with advantage have been incorporated in the text.
The volume contains facsimiles of <span class="sc">Horace Walpole's</span> handwriting,
an etching of <span class="sc">Lawrence's</span> portrait, and a reproduction of
the sketch of Strawberry Hill which illustrated the catalogue of
1774. Altogether a delightful book that will, my Baronite says,
take its place on a favourite shelf of the library that has grown up
round the memory of one of the most interesting figures of the Eighteenth
Century.</p>

[In the report on the proposed Mombasa Railway, it is suggested that the
station-buildings should be enclosed with a strong live-thorn palisade, impenetrable
to arrows.]

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Station on the Mombasa Railway.</i></p>

<p><i>New Station-Master</i> (<i>to</i> Telegraph Clerk). Did you send my
message this morning, asking for a consignment of revolvers and
arrow-proof shields?</p>

<p><i>Telegraph Clerk.</i> Yes, Sir. I can't make out why we haven't
had an answer. Something may have gone wrong with the wires.
I sent one of the porters to examine them. Ah, here he comes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Porter arrives.</i></p>

<p><i>Porter.</i> Just as I thought, Sir. Them blessed niggers have run
short of cash, and they've bin and took a mile of our best wire.</p>

<p><i>Station-Master.</i> Taken a mile of wire? What the deuce do you
mean?</p>

<p><i>Porter.</i> Ah, Sir, you're new to this 'ere job. Fact is, they can
all buy theirselves a wife a-piece for two yards of our wire; and as
there was a raid last week, and all their wives was made off with,
they've just bin and took our telegraph wire to buy theirselves a
new lot.</p>

<p><i>Station-Master.</i> Dear me, how very provoking. I must make a
report of this occurrence immediately! But what does this crowd in
the distance mean?</p>

<p><i>Porter.</i> Why bless my heart, it's a Wednesday, and I'd quite
forgotten all about it. They always attacks us of a Wednesday, but
they're a good half hour earlier than last week.</p>

<p><i>Station-Master.</i> This is very strange, very strange indeed. I doubt
if the directors will approve of this. (<i>An arrow pierces him in the
calf of the leg.</i>) Oh, I say, you know, this will never do. Close the
points&mdash;I mean shut the doors and barricade the windows. Let us
at least die as railway men should.</p>

<p><i>Porter.</i> Lor' bless you, Sir, we shan't die. We've only got to
pick off two or three dozen of 'em, and the rest will skip in no time.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They retire within the palisade, and during the next half hour
fight for their lives.</i></p>

are getting a bit hot. Hurrah! here's the 5.30 down express with
revolvers and ammunition. Now we shall settle 'em.</p>

<p>It seems the poor soul's faithful friend, and oftentimes the last and only.</p>

<p>Stranded, alone, at seventy-five, after a life of luckless labour,</p>

<p>Where we've gone wrong, and, in regrets employ our wheezy, worn old bellows.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<p>Their fretting at cold, hard-fast rules, their fancy for sly bacca-puffing,</p>
<p>Could only scan the paupers' past a little closer than their mode is,</p>
<p>They'd learn that still some sparks of soul burn in those broken-down old bodies.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And soul does kick at iron rules, and icy ways. Old blood runs chilly,</p>
<p>And craves the heat, of love, fire, pipe, to warm it up like. Very silly,</p>
<p>No doubt, from <span class="sc">Bumble's</span> point of view! <i>Here</i> we're held human, though so humble;</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE À L'AMERICAINE.</h3>

<p class="ind"><i>Telegram No. 1.</i>&mdash;Nothing could have been more terrible
than the scene following upon the earthquake. The
houses sank through the ground, and immediately a
number of lions, tigers, and poisonous serpents, attracted
by the unusual occurrence, sprang upon the poor inhabitants,
and by their fierce attacks increased their misfortune.
But this was not all. Men and women, using
swords, battle-axes, and revolvers, fought amongst
themselves, until the commotion created by the landslip
assumed the appearance of a pandemonium. At this
moment, to make confusion worse confounded, a heavy
storm broke over the fast-disappearing village, and
thunderbolts fell like peas expelled through a peashooter.
As if this were not enough, several prairie
fires crept up, and the flames augmented the general
discomfort. Take it all and all, the sight was enough to
make the cheek grow pale with terror and apprehension.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Telegram No. 2.</i>&mdash;Please omit lions, tigers, poisonous

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 26.</i>&mdash;Hardly knew House
to-night. Benches mostly empty; few present seemed to have no
fight in them. Little round at outset on Betterment principle.
Members roughly and not inaccurately illustrated it by staying outside.
"In principle," said <span class="sc">Philippe Egalité</span>, "the Terrace is
Better meant for this weather than the House." Mr. G. in his place,
listening eagerly to speeches by <span class="sc">Kimber</span>, <span class="sc">Fergusson</span>, and other
oratorical charmers. Generally believed that he had gone off to
Hatchlands for holiday; nothing for him to do here; Home-Rule
debate postponed till Wednesday; Supply, in meantime, might well
be left to Minister in charge.</p>

<p>"The fact is, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said Mr. G., when I remarked upon the
pleasurable surprise of finding him in his place, "I really did think
of making a little holiday, staying away till Wednesday. But when
I got up this morning, looked round at green fields and lofty trees,
they irresistibly reminded me of benches in House of Commons, and
the pillars that support the gallery. Then the sunlit sky is very nice
in its way; but do you know anything softer, more translucent or
attractive than the light that floods the House of Commons from
the glass roof? The more I thought of these things the more restless
I grew amid tame attractions of rural life. This morning it might
have been said of me, in the words of the poet,</p>

<p>to Westminster. The country is there all through the year and
every day: Parliamentary Session lasts only seven, or at best eight
months. This year, if we've luck, we may run it into ten. But
then House doesn't meet every day. One is expected to go off to
seaside, or somewhere else, from Saturday to Monday. Thinking of
these things, couldn't resist temptation. So suddenly packed up,
drove off, and here I am. Needn't stop all night, you know, if you
fellows grudge me a little enjoyment; but shall at least begin
evening pleasantly. Shall vote in division on Betterment question,
and make statement on arrangements for Indian Currency."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Some votes in Navy Estimates.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span> and <span class="sc">W. Woodall</span>, V.C., the
Casabiancas of the evening. They sit on Treasury Bench, whence all
but they have fled; listen with polite attention to talk round Army
Estimates; and when there's anything like a lull get up and say few
words. Whole proceeding a farce of drearily colossal proportions.
Major-General <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> prances to front, reviews British forces
under present Administration, finds many buttons loose, and
numerous gaiters askew. Opportunity useful for showing that this
Eminent Legislator has not given up entirely to Home Rule what
was meant for mankind. Omniscience <span class="sc">Hanbury's</span> forte; Army
Reform his foible. Honourable distinction for him that he has
never drawn the sword on any tented field. Debates on Army
Estimates invariably call to the front an amazing reserve force of
unsuspected men of war. There are Colonels, Majors, and Captains
enough to officer the army at Monaco.</p>

<p>There's <span class="sc">Webster</span> of East St. Pancras for example. The few
Members present gasped for breath when, just now, he offered few
observations on War Office management. What did he do in this
galley? Well known that in interval of revising his popular
Dictionary he trifles with the law. Might, in course of time, come
to be Lord Chancellor; but never Field Marshal. That only
shows how limited is current information, how true the observation
that the world knows nothing of its greatest men. Why, for sixteen
years <span class="sc">Webster</span> served with distinction in the Third Battalion South
Lancashire Regiment! Under his civilian waistcoat to this day he
coyly hides the bronze medal for Blameless Conduct.</p>

<p>That he should take part in debate on Army Estimates not
only natural, but, in national interests, imperatively desirable.
<span class="sc">Hanbury's</span> case quite otherwise. He never set a squadron a field,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
nor the division of a battle knows more than <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>.
Yet <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> is not more glib, authoritative, or, on the
whole, more entertaining when Army Estimates are to the fore.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Army Estimates in Committee.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Friday</span>, 4 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Came upon <span class="sc">Nussey</span> an hour ago putting
himself
to bed on a chair in the Library. This his first experience
of Parliamentary life; introduced at four o'clock yesterday
afternoon, and took his seat for Pontefract. "Lawka mussey!
and is this <span class="sc">Nussey</span>?" cried <span class="sc">Wilfred Lawson</span>, whose aptitude for
dropping into poetry beats <i>Silas Wegg</i> hollow. It certainly was
<span class="sc">Nussey</span> yesterday afternoon, and this is what is left of him in the
sunshine of a summer morning.</p>

<p>"Didn't think," he said, with a feeble smile, "that on occasion of
my proud entrance upon Parliamentary life I should forthwith be
made into an all-night <span class="sc">Nussey</span>. All very well to grow gradually
into that state of life. Begin, say, with suspending twelve-o'clock
rule, and getting off at one or two in the morning. But to plunge
straight in like this is, if I may say so, a little hard on newcomer
fresh from country. I suppose, from look of it, that it is only
beginning of things. An all-night <span class="sc">Nussey</span> to-day; a weekly
<span class="sc">Nussey</span>
before parched July has wet its lips; and so on, till I become a
monthly <span class="sc">Nussey</span>. Very kind of you to come and see me, but if you
don't mind, I'll just drop off to sleep. Put the Amendments to the
Home Rule Bill on the chimbley, and I'll take a look at them when
I feel dispoged."</p>

<p>A nice night we've all had; moreover than which, at a quarter to
three, lemon squashes gave out, and as one of waiters in hoarse voice
assured me, there wasn't "a hounce of hice" left on premises.
Yesterday afternoon Mr. G. moved his time-table Closure scheme
in speech cogency of which testifies to miraculous advantage of limitation
of delivery within space of half-hour. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> followed
in best debating speech he has delivered since he became
Leader. Most adroit in argument, excellent in manner, felicitous in
phrasing. He, too, brief, and therefore necessarily to the point.
After this flood-tide of talk opened, and flowed, shallow but persistent,
for next four hours. <span class="sc">Napoleon Boltonparty</span>, getting on
board the Raft of Tilsit-cum-North-St.-Pancras, drifted up and
down on washy flood. Erect, arms folded, and imperial hat cocked
defiantly at Mr. G. Liberals howled at him; shouts of "Moscow!
Moscow!" mingled with cries of "Waterloo!" and "St. Helena!"
N. B. shook his golden lilies in their teeth, and punted his Raft into
the Tory harbour.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Joey C.</span> turned up after early dinner, and the waters were
speedily lashed into foam. Following the illustrious example of
<span class="sc">Napoleon Boltonparty</span>, <span class="sc">Joseph</span> threw off all mask of deference
to
former leader. Hitherto, even in moments of hottest conflict,
<span class="sc">Joey C.</span> has been sly, dev'lish sly, in his hearing towards his
"right hon. friend." To-night he went for him, just as in days not
so very far off good Conservatives like <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, amid thunderous
Tory cheers, used to gird at the hero of the Aston Park Riots. "I
admire the artful&mdash;&mdash;" Here he paused, and looked down with bitter
smile on the apparently sleeping figure of Mr. G. on the Treasury
Bench. Five hundred lips in the listening throng involuntarily
formed the syllables in familiar conjunction with the adjective.
No, not yet. At present pace of progression "dodger" may come.
To-night <span class="sc">Joseph</span> content, having gained the desired effect, to
conclude the sentence with the words "&mdash;&mdash;minister who drew up this
resolution."</p>

<p>At two o'clock this morning note was taken of fact that Mr. G.,
having been in his place almost incessantly since four yesterday afternoon,
had carried his more than four score years off to bed. <span class="sc">Squire
of Malwood</span> thought all sections of House would be anxious to spare
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> further vigil. <span class="sc">Joseph</span> up like catapult.
"Perfectly absurd," he snapped, "to attempt to make a fetish of
name and age of <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>."</p>

<p>"There's one good thing we may hope to see come out of this
night," said Member for Sark. "It should make an end of the
treacly farce which bandies between hopelessly parted colleagues the
title 'right hon. friend.'"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Sat for thirteen hours, and negatived first
Amendment to Closure Resolution.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Having got away late last night, made up for it by
coming back early this afternoon. Morning sitting, but no more
fight left. Quite content with heroic struggle through long summer
night; everything over by seven o'clock.</p>

<p>Hear touching story, which shows how deeply rooted in human
mind is habit of censoriousness. Not two more respectable-looking
men in House than <span class="sc">Bartley</span> and <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>. To be in their
company is to receive a liberal education in deportment. Walking
home this morning, after all-night sitting, in sad converse on possibilities
of fresh development of iniquity on part of Mr. G., they
passed couple of British workmen going forth to day's labour. Said
first British Workman, nudging his companion, and pointing with
thumb over his shoulder at wearied legislators: "Tell you what,
<span class="sc">Bill</span>, <i>them</i> coves ain't been up to much good."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Closure Resolutions agreed to. Home-Rule Bill
packed up in compartments, to be opened as directed.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
